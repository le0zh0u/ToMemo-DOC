# Using Memory Palace

## What is a Memory Palace?

A "memory palace" is a metaphorical term that symbolizes any place we are familiar with and can easily remember. It can be your home, or the route you take to work every day. This familiar place becomes your guide for storing and retrieving any information.

As we continuously input short-term memories, we need anchors (familiar places) to connect these memories. Anything that conforms to this anchor rule can be stored.

When we need them, we can find the memories that were once related by following these anchors.

The concept of Memory Palace used in this app borrows from the “Memory Palace” memory method, where each room is a guide for storing and retrieving any information. The app uses custom rules (regular expressions, etc.) as the entry to retrieve short-term memory, while the "Memory Palace" memory method requires you to assign positions and meanings to each object in the room.

If you feel that this is inappropriate use of the Memory Palace, you can rename it to "Intelligent Grouping" in the settings.
