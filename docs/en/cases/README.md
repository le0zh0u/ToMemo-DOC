# Classic Case

## Chinese Text Formatting

In documents with a mix of Chinese and English, additional spacing is needed for text formatting to enhance the reading experience, especially when Chinese and English are intertwined, spacing should be added at the connection points.

However, this work requires careful attention and is tedious, and it is most comfortable to leave it to a program.

In the settings of Short-term Memory, adding `Chinese Text Formatting` as a pre-processing step can automatically format the text when it is saved to the application, making excellent formatting effortless.

## Memory Palace

As the amount of content in short-term memory grows, simply listing the content cannot effectively extract the value of data with specific characteristics.

For example, for users who copy multiple URLs every day, the list in short-term memory will be mixed with other text data, which increases the search cost for text content of URL type.

The Memory Palace can effectively improve this situation.

## New Year Blessings

As New Year approaches, we send blessings to our loved ones with joy in our hearts. While a simple `Happy New Year` includes our heartfelt wishes, a well-crafted message can make the recipient feel even more surprised and loved.

However, high-quality blessing messages may not come easily when needed, and searching for them can be inefficient. This is where the collection of `New Year Blessing` phrases comes in handy.

After configuring the data, you can quickly output high-quality blessing messages on the keyboard. Moreover, the “sender information” in the message will be automatically replaced with your name, making the blessing even more personalized.

For more information, please refer to 「[Common Questions/How to Use New Year Blessing Phrases](/en/questions/)」 in the app.

## Maintaining WeChat Groups

Some students need to manage several WeChat groups, and as their business develops, the number of groups keeps increasing.

Each group requires the same group rules, promotional copies, interactive copies, and after-sales response copies… Every time, they need to look through the chat history of the old groups, or copy and paste the same language in different software, which can be very frustrating.

::: tip
By saving the content from the first group as a template text in ToMemo, in the future groups, users only need to open the keyboard, find the list, and click on “Memo”. They do not need to search and scroll through the chat history again.
