# Privacy Policy

ToMemo is a super easy-to-use note-taking app for iOS that can be used for frequent content memos and short-term content records. It also supports iCloud syncing across multiple devices.

This privacy policy primarily applies to the ToMemo main program and internally integrated frameworks and services.

## Privacy Permissions

In order to allow the program to function properly, the following permissions may be required for ToMemo:

• iCloud Syncing: Syncing data to other devices through iCloud if multiple device usage is required.
• Accessing Clipboard: Getting the clipboard and saving it to short-term memory if clipboard history is required.

### iCloud Syncing

The data synchronization feature in ToMemo is based on the iCloud service provided by Apple. As you can imagine, this service is quite secure and is trusted by users around the world.

Importantly, this has nothing to do with the services we provide, and no data will be sent to our servers. At the same time, we do not have servers specifically for data synchronization.

### Accessing Clipboard

Can your clipboard be read without your knowledge?

No. We have to admit that it is quite convenient to get copied content in the background. However, this is impossible on iOS because reading the clipboard requires the app to be in an active state.

In addition, if you are using iOS 16, the system will prompt you for each clipboard operation and you cannot directly save clipboard data through a widget.

##Data Collection

In short, the ToMemo application itself does not collect any of your data. Yes, we do not use any data tracking technology for growth purposes, and we do not even count how many users we have. We just want to provide a safe environment for storing and using content, and we do not care about the scale of our users or how our app is being used by them.

In addition, when you use the services of certain service providers, you may need to enter your own credentials into the ToMemo main program to use it normally. ToMemo only saves your credentials in local and iCloud, and does not upload them to other servers.

Besides that, please have confidence in our services. All privacy information is forever preserved on your device, and we cannot control it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update our privacy policy to adapt to the latest ToMemo situation. Therefore, we recommend that you regularly check this page for the latest content.

We will notify you of any changes by posting new privacy policies on this page. All changes will take effect immediately after they are published on this page.
