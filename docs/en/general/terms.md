# Terms of Use

Thank you for using ToMemo. Your support motivates us to improve this product.

## Pricing Policy

The core features of ToMemo, such as memo, list, and short-term memory, are all free. We also offer the **ToMemo Advance** to meet the customization needs of professional users while maintaining our development work.

ToMemo Pro offers a variety of pricing strategies to meet different needs, such as monthly or yearly subscriptions, or one-time payment for permanent unlock. The subscription model provides **a free trial period for Pro features**. It’s worth mentioning that if you use the subscription model, the preferential price you are using will be maintained during renewals and will not increase with the subsequent price increases of the product. The permanent unlock is valid for all subsequent updates, including major version updates. The payment plan is **buyout + subscription**.

ToMemo’s personalized keyboard skins require payment. After purchasing the selected skin, you can use it unlimitedly under the same account. The payment plan for the skins is **buyout**.

::: tip Plan Introduction
- Buyout: You only need to pay once and can use it permanently.
- Subscription: Subscribing monthly allows you to try all features conveniently. Subscribing yearly is the biggest support for us.
